# DiabeticRetinopathyDetection

Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in early stage
is essential to avoid complete blindness. The retinal fundus
images of the patients are procured by capturing the fundus of
the eye with a digital fundus camera. Fundus Images should be
pre-processed to remove the noise, preserve the edges of an
image, and enhance the image quality for carrying out further
image analysis. This paper provides various pre-processing
techniques for detection of DR. The abnormalities in retinal
fundus images due to DR are Lesions which includes
Microaneurysms, Hemorrhages, exudates and blood vessels. In
this study cannyâ€™s edge detector is used for detection of Lesions
and features are extracted.
